# Rogue

## Description
Rogue is an online application with features of a simplified version of Instagram. The platform lets users post photos on their accounts which are viewable by other users that can themselves leave comments or upvotes/downvotes. As well as viewing other users posts, a user will be able to "follow" them to add their content to a feed and receive a notification.

## Objectives
Learn how to use different tools to develop software and implement Agile methods in our workflow. The goal is to deliver incremental working software throughout each end of the Sprints (Potentially Shippable Product Increment). We shall follow the Agile Manifesto:
* __Individuals and interactions__ over processes and tools
* __Working software__ over comprehensive documentation
* __Customer collaboration__ over contract negotiation
* __Responding to change__ over following a plan

## Tech Stack (Laravel)
* PHP
* Vue.js
* mySQL
